# ParrotBot

**Please note: As Discord has had a native quotation feature for a long time now and this here implementation is no longer compatible with current versions of Python and its Discord library, this project is no longer being developed. Thank you to anyone who used or contributed to ParrotBot!**

ParrotBot was a simple Discord bot solving a simple Discord problem: That it
didn’t support quotation.

## Usage
With ParrotBot, you can easily quote other messages, as long as they are in the
same channel and weren’t posted too long ago.¹ Just send a message containing
a greater-sign (>), followed by an excerpt from the message you want to quote –
just like many people do anyways. Message IDs work, as well. ParrotBot will
automatically find the most recent occurrence of this quote, display the
according message in a box, and delete the text-only quote you sent (if you
allow it to):

![Example quote](https://github.com/mart-w/parrotbot/blob/master/doc_img/example_quote.png?raw=true)

![Example result](https://github.com/mart-w/parrotbot/blob/master/doc_img/example_quote_result.png?raw=true)

“But what if there are multiple similar messages from different users and it’s
not the last one I want to quote,” I hear you ask? Well, in this case, you can
just put the user name, nickname or user ID of the author in front of the
greater-sign and clever little ParrotBot will only consider messages from that
user.

In both of those cases, the bot will find an display the whole quoted message.
If you prefer it to show just the part of the message you gave to it, use two
greater-signs (`>>`).

Also see the help and info commands: Just type `@ParrotBot info` or
`@ParrotBot help` (replace `@ParrotBot` whatever other name you gave it).
You can also visit [ParrotBot’s support Discord](https://discord.gg/rMXH2Rg)
if you need any help.


¹ To reduce server load, the number of messages searched is limited.

## Installation
You don’t have to host ParrotBot yourself. There is a public instance of it
being hosted for you – just click [here](https://discordbots.org/bot/parrotbot)
and select “Invite”. You can also find the bot on
[bots.discord.pw](https://bots.discord.pw/bots/363007359204982786).

To run ParrotBot on your own machine, you need Python 3.5 or higher and
[discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) v0.15.0 or higher.
ParrotBot also uses the modules `asyncio`, `datetime`, `json`, `re`, and
`urllib2`, but those should normally already be part of your Python
installation. You also need a Discord bot user and its API token
(see https://discordapp.com/developers for further information on that).

If you have all that, just clone this repository. Then you’re ready to go!
Insert your bot’s client ID into this URL:

    https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR_ID_HERE&scope=bot&permissions=8192

Open it, choose the server you want to add your bot to and click on “Authorize”.
Then the only thing left to do is to fire up `parrotbot.py` and quote away!

## Contribution
If you find a bug or want to suggest a new feature, feel free to create a new
issue here on GitHub, I will look into it.

If you feel like contributing to the codebase itself, that is also appreciated!
Just fork the project, make your changes and file a pull request that describes
what you’ve done. Please try to write clean, understandable code and document it
as described in
[Python’s docstring conventions](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/#specification).

Whatever you do: Please stay polite and friendly. We’re all doing this for fun.
